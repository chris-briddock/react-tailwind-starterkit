# Vite + TypeScript + React + Jest + Playwright + Tailwind Starter Kit

This starter kit provides a streamlined setup for a modern web application using Vite for development, TypeScript for type-checking, Jest for unit tests, and Playwright for end-to-end tests.

## Features

- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated web dev build tool.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **Playwright**: A Node library to automate browsers using the browser's built-in DevTools protocol.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs with minimal effort. This starter kit contains a light and dark theme context already done.
